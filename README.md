# BiosignalSynthesis
This tool is aimed to learn and synthesize biosignals, in case they have a pattern that repeats over time. In order to use this tool, please follow the following order:
1. Pre-process
2. Configurate parameters using Signal2Model object 
3. Create LibphysMBGRU Object, which is a model object 
4. Train Model using LibphysMBGRU.train
5. Save Model using LibphysMBGRU.save
6. Load Model using LibphysMBGRU.load
7. Synthesize using LibphysMBGRU.generate_online_predicted_signal!

## Get started!
As a tuturial you can check some examples. In the sandbox directory, please use the following examples by order:
1. process_ecg_example 
2. train_ecg_example 
3. online_synthesizer_example
